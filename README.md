# TChat Project 

It is an application that allows users to contact customer service. It is made by ionic and react.

I used sessionStorage to store the chat and socket.io to transmit messages and notifications in real time.

# User Manual:

First of all you have to start the socket server which is placed in the TChatClient/server/ folder after opening the command prompt and executing "node server.cjs"
Then we can start our 2 ionic projects (Chat for user, ServiceClient for customer service).
To start them you have to go to the root of the project and open a command prompt and execute the command "ionic serve"
after that open our project on the default browser.
